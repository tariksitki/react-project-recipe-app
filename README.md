In this repository I have designed a project name "Recipe-App" 
with React , Material UI, SASS, React Router, Google Firebase.

In this project;

• Users could search recipes by meals and keywords.
• They could find the blogs they want by using the search bar.
• They could go to detail page for each recipe and get detailed information.

Thank you so much ...
